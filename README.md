# Crypto-Currency_Prediction_Using_Fin-BERT_And_Time-Series-Methods

## **Objective**  

This project aims to achieve the following objectives:  

1. **Analyze the Impact of Financial News on Crypto Prices**  
   - Investigate how financial news sentiment influences cryptocurrency price movements, addressing the gaps left by traditional time series models.  

2. **Leverage Advanced Deep Learning Models**  
   - Explore the capabilities of LSTM and FinBERT in analyzing financial news, highlighting their strengths in capturing sequential patterns and extracting meaningful insights from textual data.  

3. **Identify Limitations of LSTM and Advantages of Transformers**  
   - Examine the challenges of using LSTM for long-term dependencies in text data and demonstrate how transformer models like FinBERT address these challenges with attention mechanisms and efficient contextual analysis.  

4. **Incorporate Semantic Search for Enhanced Insights**  
   - Utilize vector-based semantic search techniques, such as `IndexFlatL2`, to retrieve relevant financial news articles efficiently.  
   - Enhance the analysis by focusing on contextually relevant information for specific cryptocurrencies.

2. **`cryptopanic.sql`**  
   - A database file comprising news headlines related to the cryptocurrency market, covering the period from September 2017 to July 2024.  

3. **`currency.csv`**  
   - A CSV file listing codes for various cryptocurrencies.  

4. **`training_data.csv`**  
   - A CSV file containing news data extracted from the `cryptopanic` database.  

5. **`price_history_data.jsonl`**  
   - A JSONL file generated by executing the `crypto-Datapreprocessing-2` Jupyter notebook.  

6. **`training_data.jsonl`**  
   - Another JSONL file produced by running the `crypto-Datapreprocessing-2` Jupyter notebook.

## **Comparative Analysis**  

| **Metric**         | **LSTM** | **FinBERT** | **FinBERT + FAISS** | **Improvement from LSTM to FinBERT** | **Improvement from FinBERT to FinBERT + FAISS** |
|---------------------|----------|-------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Test Loss (MSE)** | 0.29     | 0.19        | 0.17                 | 34.48%                                | 10.53%                                        |
| **Test RMSE**       | 0.40     | 0.05        | 0.04                 | 87.50%                                | 20.00%                                        |
